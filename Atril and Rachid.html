            <p class="firpr">At Microverse, students learn through a very unique approach â€” by pair programming and collaborating with other students in real time, just as they would with colleagues of a distributed team in a real company.</p>
            <p class="secpr">Students learn multiple programming languages and Computer Science fundamentals, through working on real projects with other students around the world.</p>
            <p class="thpr">This innovative approach not only provides students with an accountability partner and large, global network of support, but also helps them learn remote workflows and acquire the collaboration and communication skills necessary to join a global company.</p>
            <p class ="forpr">Once students are done with the curriculum, we help them improve their portfolio, resume and online presence, and get ready for job interviews. Then, we help them find and apply to competitive jobs worldwide and negotiate job offers.</p>
